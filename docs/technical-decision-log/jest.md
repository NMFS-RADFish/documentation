# Jest

- **Why we chose this:** Jestâ€™s simplicity and integration with React make it ideal for RADFish's testing needs, ensuring components function correctly across different scenarios, including offline usage and multi-entry forms. Its snapshot testing capabilities are crucial for maintaining consistency in UI components and adhering to NOAA's branding guidelines.
- **Trade-offs:** Its benefits in ensuring application reliability outweigh any concerns regarding testing overhead, especially for complex applications within the NOAA ecosystem.

Mocha and Jasmine are alternatives that provide flexible configuration and extensive assertion libraries. However, Jest's zero-config setup, along with its snapshot testing features, offers a more straightforward approach for RADFish's testing strategy, despite Mocha or Jasmine's customizability.
