# React and Create React App

- **Why we chose this:** React's component-based architecture aligns perfectly with RADFish's need for reusable, maintainable, and modular components. Given NOAA's diverse data reporting and collection requirements, React facilitates the development of dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to various data types and workflows. Create React App (CRA) CLI tooling offers a quick start with zero initial configuration, essential for standardized project setups across government contractors.
- **Trade-offs:** The learning curve for React might limit customization for highly specific NOAA requirements. However, the trade-off is justified by the efficiency gains in development speed and application performance.
