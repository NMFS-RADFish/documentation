# Purpose

In order to provide transparency and clarity around the technical decisions we (Sudokrew) have made, we wanted to provide a technical decision justification for the chosen technologies and frameworks of RADFish.

Each technology and framework selected for RADFish aims to create a cohesive, efficient, and compliant environment for developing NOAA's frontend applications. The choices reflect a balance between ease of use, compliance with federal standards, and the unique operational requirements of NOAA applications, such as offline functionality and support across a myriad of devices. The chosen stack is designed to optimize developer productivity, application performance, and user experience within the context of NOAA fishery reporting programs.
