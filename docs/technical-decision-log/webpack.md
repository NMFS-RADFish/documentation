# Webpack

- **Why we chose this:** Webpackâ€™s ability to bundle and optimize assets is crucial for RADFish applications, ensuring they load efficiently, even in bandwidth-constrained environments like offshore locations. Its extensive plugin ecosystem allows for custom optimizations, such as service worker integration for offline functionality.
- **Trade-offs:** Webpack's configuration complexity can be daunting, but RADFish benefits from standardized builds and optimizations that enhance application performance and user experience, justifying the initial setup complexity.

Parcel and Rollup are simpler bundling tools that require less configuration. While they offer quicker setup times, Webpack's extensive plugin ecosystem and loader support provide a level of customization necessary for RADFish's varied project requirements.
