# Tanstack for State Management

- **Why we chose this:** Tanstack (React Query and React Table) offers efficient solutions for managing server state and table state in RADFish applications. This is particularly useful for handling NOAA's complex data structures and multi-entry forms, providing an improved user experience with less boilerplate code.
- **Trade-offs:** The adoption of Tanstack requires familiarity with its API and concepts, which may present a learning curve. However, the productivity gains and enhanced user experience in handling NOAAâ€™s data-centric applications make it a great choice for RADFish's goals.
