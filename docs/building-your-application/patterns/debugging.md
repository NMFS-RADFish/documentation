# Debugging

Debugging plays pivotal roles in the development of Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) by enabling developers to track real-time performance, identify/fix bugs, optimize code, and enhance overall user experience.

There are several common strategies for debugging a web application during development. These include but are not limited to:

- Adding breakpoints in code editor: [See vscode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints)
- Adding logs to the development console: [See MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/learn-javascript-console-methods/)
- Using the network console: [See Chrome DevTools documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network)
- Using an HTTP client like Postman to test API calls: [See Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/)

Note that you can use postman in conjunction with the Mock Service Worker that is bundled with RadFish in order to emulate a backend server response pattern.
