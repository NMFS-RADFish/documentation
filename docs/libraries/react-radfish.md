# `react-radfish`

The `react-radfish` NPM package contains the React component library needed to power any RADFish project built with React or React flavored framework (like Remix or Next.js). The idea is that these modules expose components that can be used in a consistent fashion across different React projects.

Note that this library is not meant to replace the `@trussworks` library, and is meant to live alongside it. Where possible, you should look to leverage the `@trussworks` library. However, if there is a component not exposed by `@trussworks`, or there is some shortcoming with the `@trussworks` implementation, you can rely on the components exposed from the `@nmfs-radfish/react-radfish` package.

This library is open source and can be found here: (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nmfs-radfish/react-radfish)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nmfs-radfish/react-radfish]
