# Trussworks Component Library

- **Why we chose this:** Trussworks Component Library’s adherence to USWDS ensures RADFish applications meet federal standards for accessibility and design. This alignment with NOAA’s branding guidelines and 508 compliance requirements makes it a strategic choice.
- **Trade-offs:** The use of a specific component library might restrict design flexibility. However, the consistency and compliance it brings to RADFish applications are invaluable, especially for government projects.

Material-UI and Ant Design offer extensive component libraries with customizable themes. However, Trussworks' specific focus on USWDS compliance and its integration with React makes it a better fit for RADFish, despite the broader design options available in Material-UI or Ant Design
