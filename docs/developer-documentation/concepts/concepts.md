# Concepts

We often find ourselves building applications that serve users in a variety of settings - from busy ports to remote fishing grounds. One group is commercial fishermen, tasked with harvesting and processing fish for quality and quantity. Their work takes them into the open sea, where internet connectivity can be unreliable or even non-existent.

Imagine being a commercial fisherman on a vessel, sorting through catch and recording weights and species for quality control while waiting for critical data to sync with offices back on land.

**What does offline-first mean?**

Offline-first is an approach to building web applications that prioritize functionality even without internet connectivity. This means designing the app to store data locally (on-device), so users can continue interacting with it seamlessly, even when out of range of a stable network.

With Offline-First, your application:

1. **Stores data locally**: When the user interacts with the app, data is cached on the device, allowing for continued functionality offline.
2. **Synchronizes data automatically**: As soon as internet connectivity returns, the app synchronizes any pending changes with remote servers.
3. **Provides a seamless experience**: No matter whether online or offline, your users enjoy an uninterrupted experience.

**Service Workers: The Key to Offline-First**

To achieve offline-first functionality, developers use Service Workers - scripts that run in the background of web applications, allowing for network requests and data caching without requiring user interaction. By leveraging Service Workers, you can build robust and resilient web applications that remain functional even when faced with internet connectivity issues.
